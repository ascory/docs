# Ascory API documentation
This documentation will help in mastering the basic API for working with Ascory
## Getting started
Almost any interaction with the API requires specifying a store ID and hash. You can easily find out the store ID in the parameters of your store or from support. The hash must be generated by you personally. 
## Hash for API
The hash is a BCrypt hashed string containing the first storage key, the second storage key, and the IP address of the server from which the request was sent. A ":" must be inserted between the data.Note that your server can send the request via IPv6.
### Example of PHP hash generation
```php
<?php
$id = 1;
$key1 = "c0a9cc6d8d4243c4a644f8e57d085438";
$key2 = "56d4f8ee1ee480707ee9f3210da5aca2";
$string = $id.":".$key1.":".$key2; # 1:c0a9cc6d8d4243c4a644f8e57d085438:56d4f8ee1ee480707ee9f3210da5aca2
$hash = password_hash($string, PASSWORD_BCRYPT); 
```
