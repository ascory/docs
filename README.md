# Ascory API documentation
This documentation will help in mastering the basic API for working with Ascory
## Getting started
Almost any interaction with the API requires specifying a store ID and hash. You can easily find out the store ID in the parameters of your store or from support. The hash must be generated by you personally. 
## Hash for API
The hash is a hashed string containing the first shop key, the second shop key, and the IP address of the server from which the request originates. Note that your server can send the request via IPv6.
